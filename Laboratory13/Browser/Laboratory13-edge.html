        <p class="brief"><b>Microsoft Edge</b> is a web browser developed by <b>Microsoft,</b>
        the technology company founded by <b>Bill Gates.</b>. It was created to provide
        a fast, secure, and modern browsing experience, replacing <b>Internet Explorer</b>
        as the default browser in Windows. Since 2020, <b>Edge</b> has been based on the
        Chromium engine, the same open-source platform used by <b>Google Chrome,</b> allowing
        for improved performance, security, and compatibility with popular web extensions
